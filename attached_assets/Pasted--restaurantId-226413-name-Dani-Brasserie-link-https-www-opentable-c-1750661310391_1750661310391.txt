    "topReview": "We had the most wonderful late lunch on the last day of our stay in Madrid. The restaurant is elegant, the service excellent, and the food worthy of its Michelin status. We started with the extraordinary guacamole, which was carefully prepared at our table by the superb Alvaro (see photo). He said that the avocados are from M√°laga, which has only been growing them for about ten years. The avocados are wonderfully enhanced by the semi-dried tomatoes, edamame, sunflower seeds, and crunchy tempura, For a sort of main course we both ordered the amazing club sandwich with Baeri caviar! We've never had anything quite like it.\nWe were seated inside (so hot & sunny outside) by a window, as we requested. When we were ready to leave Alvaro suggested we walk onto the terrace. Magnifico!\nWe will come back to Dani every time we're in Madrid, which we hope will be often.",
